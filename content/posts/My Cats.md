I live with two cats. They don't get along. Their names are
1. Biskut
2. Cacao

Here are their photos:

We have to keep them separate otherwise they have ugly fights. It's been 3 months and the progress is negligible. it's pretty tiresome. It's a good thing that we have rooms in the house to spare. We keep our doors closed and don't let the two cats meet.
I have been putting effort. I have been feeding them their favorite treats side by side with a safe separation between them.  Also, not surprisingly , they have caught fleas (Cacao came with fleas from her former owner's house). We washed everything and changed litter and gave them flea drops. I also comb both of the cats every single day and kill fleas by hand. It's lot of work. When I imagined getting another cat (esp because biscuit seemed so lonely and we wanted to go out more by keeping the cats home so I thought the company would be good instead they hate each other.), this is not quite what I envisioned.
