      <description>&lt;p&gt;I live with two cats. They don&amp;rsquo;t get along. Their names are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biskut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cacao&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are their photos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biscuit
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pasted%20image%2020250218001833.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cacao
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pasted%20image%2020250218001902.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to keep them separate otherwise they have ugly fights. It&amp;rsquo;s been 3 months and the progress is negligible. it&amp;rsquo;s pretty tiresome. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing that we have rooms in the house to spare. We keep our doors closed and don&amp;rsquo;t let the two cats meet.
I have been putting effort. I have been feeding them their favorite treats side by side with a safe separation between them.  Also, not surprisingly , they have caught fleas (Cacao came with fleas from her former owner&amp;rsquo;s house). We washed everything and changed litter and gave them flea drops. I also comb both of the cats every single day and kill fleas by hand. It&amp;rsquo;s lot of work. When I imagined getting another cat (esp because biscuit seemed so lonely and we wanted to go out more by keeping the cats home so I thought the company would be good instead they hate each other.), this is not quite what I envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
